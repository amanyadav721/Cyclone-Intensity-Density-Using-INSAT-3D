This project comprises a two-fold structure: a machine learning model utilizing Tensorflow and Keras, trained on Infrared images to predict tropical cyclone wind intensities, and a website portal created with Django and React.js. The code organization includes a CNN model folder for machine learning, containing Model.py, download.py, and assemble.py for data acquisition. The website's frontend, built with React.js, is housed in the Frontend folder, while the Django app intensity_app manages the backend. In the use case, the CNN model's predictions are fed into a Postgres Database, accessed by the website's backend to present data on the user portal.
